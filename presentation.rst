Vulnerabilities

Known, unpatched vulnerabilities
--------------------------------

Ethical Issues
==============

* Disclosing user data
* Discovering confidential data
* Appropriate disclosure if client doesn't fix vulnerabilities
    * Unfixed problems can endanger client's users
* Destructive vs. non-destructive testing
    * DoS attacks impact users, but would be available to malicious intruders

What results might be found? 
============================

.. note:: 
    Who would discover that a vulnerability had been exploited? (pentester, DBA, sysadmins, etc.)

    How would the pentester's results be presented?

    What actions would be taken by the company as a result?
